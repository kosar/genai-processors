# Design Document: Real-time Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data with `genai` Processors

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a system that performs real-time sentiment analysis on a stream of social media data using the `genai` processor library. This system will be designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use, showcasing the power and flexibility of the `genai` library. Instead of relying on a live data stream from a social media platform, we will use a public dataset to ensure reproducibility and accessibility.

## 2. System Architecture

The system will be composed of the following components:

*   **Data Ingestion:** A processor that reads social media data from a public dataset (e.g., a CSV file).
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** A `genai` processor that uses a pre-trained language model to perform sentiment analysis on each social media post.
*   **Real-time Visualization:** A web-based interface that displays the results of the sentiment analysis in real-time.

### 2.1. Data Flow

1.  The Data Ingestion processor reads a social media post from the dataset.
2.  The post is passed to the Sentiment Analysis processor.
3.  The Sentiment Analysis processor determines the sentiment of the post (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
4.  The post and its sentiment are sent to the Real-time Visualization component.
5.  The visualization component updates to display the new data.

## 3. Component Design

### 3.1. Data Ingestion

We will create a new processor called `PublicDatasetReader` that will be responsible for reading data from a public dataset. This processor will be configurable to handle different dataset formats (e.g., CSV, JSON). For this project, we will use the "First GOP Debate Twitter Sentiment" dataset from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/first-gop-debate-twitter-sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/first-gop-debate-twitter-sentiment)

The `PublicDatasetReader` will have the following features:

*   Ability to read data from a specified file path.
*   Ability to specify the format of the dataset.
*   Ability to simulate a real-time stream by yielding data points at a configurable interval.

### 3.2. Sentiment Analysis

We will use a `genai` processor to perform sentiment analysis. This processor will leverage a pre-trained language model from a provider like Google's Gemini or a local model using Ollama. The processor will take a string of text as input and output a sentiment score (e.g., a value between -1 and 1) and a sentiment label (e.g., "positive", "negative", "neutral").

### 3.3. Real-time Visualization

The real-time visualization component will be a simple web page that uses WebSockets to receive data from the backend. The backend will be a Python script that orchestrates the data ingestion and sentiment analysis processors. The web page will display the social media posts and their corresponding sentiment in a clear and intuitive way.

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1. Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, `genai-processors`, `websockets`
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Dataset:** "First GOP Debate Twitter Sentiment" from Kaggle

### 4.2. Project Structure

The project will be structured as follows:

```

## 5. Future Enhancements

*   **Support for more datasets:** The `PublicDatasetReader` could be extended to support a wider range of datasets and data formats.
*   **More sophisticated sentiment analysis:** The sentiment analysis processor could be improved to provide more granular sentiment information (e.g., emotions, aspects).
*   **Interactive visualization:** The visualization component could be made more interactive, allowing users to filter and explore the data in different ways.
*   **Integration with live data sources:** The system could be extended to support live data streams from social media platforms like Twitter.
